KkthnxUI is a modular, lightweight, all-in-one overhaul for the World of Warcraft interface. It aims to streamline and clean up the interface, removing unnecessary frills and wasted space as well as fill in some of the holes left in the default UI.      

### Installation      
* Copy KkthnxUI & KkthnxUI_Config from the .zip to your World of Warcraft folder(WoW\Interface\AddOns\PLACE THEM HERE)
* Put these files  in `...C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft 3.3.5` Or where ever you have your World of Warcraft installed. You get the idea.   
* Also, make sure the game is closed when moving new files into the addon directory as it is unable to discover new files when it's already running.

### F.A.Q   
* All questions, suggestions, and bugs can be directed to me in-game or in a issues report too [Issue Report](https://github.com/Kkthnx/KkthnxUI-3.3.5/issues/new)      
* Once the UI reloads off the install, you can type **/settings** or **/settings all** if you prefer all the settings for addon profiles.   
* You can type /moveui and move certain features of the UI. More to come later.    
* If you find a bug, then properly make an [Issue Report](https://github.com/Kkthnx/KkthnxUI-3.3.5/issues/new).   

### Donations   
Donations are welcome, but not required to use the UI at all. Donations help me further my development and fuel my gaming! Donations will never be a requirement! If you would like to donate, you can do so here
